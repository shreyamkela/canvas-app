At react app start, the page shows student/faculty login message from past logins

Frontend:
---------

fix logout - sidebar remains sometimes

Enroll page when we havesearched courses and move to some other filter-searchby then searched courses should vanish, Term and name search not working correctly

/getcourses at backend - inside for loop you use res.send but it closes the connection and so more than 1 course cannot be shown


new user - check email @, check password length, student faculty button better, toggle personaErrorMessage and persona back to "" for multiple new user submits, new user email already exists?

route protection - no routing without login, no routing to faculty page if student and vice versa, session management, on page refresh session/page should be same - redux persist/localstorage, pressing back on browser should take you back without any loss - history,

ENROLLING COURSES: check student already enrolled in enrolling course, check waitlist, check capacity

make profile and courses drawer shift right

can we remove redirect state value in login.js

if route is typed in url and then tried to be visited, still home will open as the routing depends on state changes of dashboardVisisble and so on
