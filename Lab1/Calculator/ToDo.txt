equal to runs only when the last is a number
if we press an operator just after pressing an operator, the previous operator should be overwritten
full query when submitted is being processed, rather we should process it on the fly with seperate routes for add button, substract, etc with onchange, for eg if 4+5 type then send to add route and find result 9 without even pressing =, then if -5 typed after then 9-5 find result 4 and then if = pressed, print 4.
